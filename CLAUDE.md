  # Claude Working Instructions

  ## Planning-First Workflow

  1. ALWAYS plan before implementing
  2. For ANY task (coding, file creation, architecture design):
     - First outline your complete approach
     - List files to be modified
     - Show example structures/code snippets
     - Highlight key decisions that need to be made
  3. Wait for explicit approval before implementing
  4. After implementation, summarize what was done
  5. If in doubt about scope, ask for clarification first

  ## Project-Specific Guidelines

  - Focus on minimal working implementations first
  - Prioritize correct rendering and positioning of cards
  - Follow the simplified architecture in tcg-architecture.md
