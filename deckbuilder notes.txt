Rules for building the deckbuilder:
1) Use the proposal-review system we always use, where you propose changes and give me a full code review, and then I either give approval or make changes.
2) We want the user's to be able to use their own css sheets. This means all styles will be kept in a separate, dedicated css sheet. 
3) All important divs will have intuitively-named ids and/or classes.
4) We will have a "default style" css sheet that each deckbuilder will use until the creator changes it. It will be clean and simple. 

Elements
1) Header and Navbar
2) Search bar
3) Card display grid
4) Decklist

1) The Header and navbar is very simple. Displays the game name and has buttons to take you back home, game page, or dashboard.

2) The search bar is where users enter parameters to filter cards. It is between the header and the card display grid.

3) Card Display Grid - this takes up 3/4 of the width of the page. Cards are displayed in rows of 5. There are 50 cards per page. The user scrolls to move the grid and view more cards. 

4) The right quarter of the screen is where the the deck is displayed. The deckbuilder has a selection of buttons and labels at the top, like "save", "download", "import", etc. Below that is the list of the cards in the deck.
