-outline go to market strategy for app
	My go to marketing strategy is reaching out to creators directly and forming partnerships with them to get them to use my platform. ie Hinchi is perfect. He's using TTS, he's actively marketing his game, etc.
	Hinchi has his own website. He would probably want an "iframe" to embed in his website. 
-outline app MVP-alpha
	Basic Search: cost, type (if available)
	Basic onboarding UX is up
	Get local development server so I can make changes/test without affecting the live site.
	assign type w img upload
	when linking sheet preview, only show ones that didn't work.
	MVP-beta:
		Creator analytics
		TTS tool
		Advanced search
		iFrame
		cache cards in gameview so we dont have to download them everytime

More notes:
1) on the game page, show all the data we have for the card. make the table wider so we can fit all the data. so we can see that our type is working.
2) Card type filter on deckbuilder needs to actually filter by card type.
3) Visibility is on by default, so toggle should be green.
4) Hide "advanced" toggler under collapsible bar
5) add dark mode (default)
6) Need an "export deck image for TTS" which composites the deck into an image, saves it to cloudinary, and returns the url. Then they can plug that into the TTS object. Also, the TTS object needs to define a card back.

The UX:
1) they don't have a google spreadsheet, they just have folder(s) of cards. 
	a) They navigate to the folders and optionally choose types and upload the cards. 
	b) if type is present, it should display in the card list and be able to sort by it in the deckbuilder.
		this falls under, "display all the properties of a card in the card list.
	c) (Future) Editing directly from the deckbuilder so they can add searchable attributes to cards.
	d) (Future) Creating spreadsheet templates for people to start their own spreadsheets.
2) they do have a google spreadsheet:
	a) the spreadsheet needs file_name column.
	b) we need a way for them to copy and paste file names from the deckbuilder to their spreadsheet
	c) other than that, we don't tell them what to do. Whatever columns are in their spreadsheet go directly into data in their database. 
	d) We display all the data in the game card list
	e) Advanced search automatically lets you do >, = , < on integer values, and search for strings in 	string values. You can type these things into the search bar, or there's a little modal menu that drops 	down to give you a gui for it.
