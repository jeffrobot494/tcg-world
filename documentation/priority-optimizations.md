# Priority Code Optimizations for TCG-World

## Overview
This document outlines the five highest-priority code optimizations for the TCG-World project. These recommendations focus on architectural improvements that will have the greatest impact on long-term maintainability, efficiency, and extensibility as the codebase grows in size and complexity.

## Top 5 Recommended Changes

The following improvements are listed in order of their original priority based on impact. However, for implementation purposes, please refer to the "Recommended Implementation Order" section below which presents a more efficient sequence.

### 1. Implement a Proper Event System

**Current Issue**: Game state changes are handled with direct method calls between components, creating tight coupling.

**Recommendation**: Implement a centralized event system where game events (card plays, draws, phase changes, etc.) are broadcast, with interested systems subscribing to relevant events.

**Benefits**:
- Decouples components, making it easier to add or modify game mechanics
- Simplifies debugging by clearly showing cause-effect relationships
- Enables easier unit testing of isolated components
- Creates a more flexible architecture for extension

**Implementation Notes**:
- Consider using ScriptableObject-based events or C# events/delegates
- Define clear event types for core game actions (DrawCard, PlayCard, PhaseChange, etc.)
- Implement a central EventManager or use the observer pattern

### 2. Create Interfaces and Proper Abstraction

**Current Issue**: Card, CardZone, and game rules are tightly coupled with no proper abstraction.

**Recommendation**: Define clear interfaces (e.g., ICard, IGameRule, ICardContainer) and use dependency injection to allow different implementations to be swapped in and out.

**Benefits**:
- Enables extension without modifying existing code (Open/Closed Principle)
- Makes the system more testable with mock implementations
- Provides clear boundaries between system responsibilities
- Simplifies adding variant implementations (different card types, zones, etc.)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Start with core interfaces for Card, CardZone, and GameRule
- Use abstraction to represent different card types and effects
- Consider a component-based card system for more complex behavior

### 3. Refactor Singleton Implementation for Consistency

**Current Issue**: Multiple classes implement singletons differently, with inconsistent lifecycle management.

**Recommendation**: Create a standardized singleton base class or approach that ensures proper object lifecycle management and consistent access patterns.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents memory leaks and duplicate instances
- Provides predictable initialization and cleanup
- Simplifies cross-component access patterns
- Makes scene transitions more reliable

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create a generic Singleton<T> base class
- Standardize initialization and destruction behavior
- Consider using a service locator pattern for more flexible dependency management
- Handle DontDestroyOnLoad consistently

### 4. Separate AI Logic from Main Controller

**Current Issue**: AI player logic is embedded directly in the MainGame class, limiting flexibility.

**Recommendation**: Create a dedicated AI system with strategy patterns to allow for multiple AI behaviors and difficulty levels.

**Benefits**:
- Enables multiple AI types and difficulty levels
- Keeps the main game controller focused and maintainable
- Makes AI behavior easier to tune and debug
- Provides cleaner separation of concerns

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create an IAIStrategy interface
- Implement different concrete strategies (Aggressive, Defensive, etc.)
- Use a factory pattern to create appropriate AI based on difficulty or player preferences
- Move all AI-specific code out of MainGame

### 5. Implement Centralized Resource/State Management

**Current Issue**: State checks are scattered throughout the codebase with redundant validation logic.

**Recommendation**: Create a centralized game state manager that handles resource checks, validity of actions, and phase permissions to ensure consistent rule enforcement.

**Benefits**:
- Ensures consistent rule enforcement
- Makes game balance adjustments simpler
- Reduces duplicate validation logic
- Creates a single source of truth for game state

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create a GameStateManager that serves as the authority on legality of actions
- Move validation logic from individual components into this central system
- Implement proper state patterns for different game phases
- Make game rules data-driven where possible

## Recommended Implementation Order

For maximum efficiency and to minimize rework, implement these changes in the following order:

1. **Refactor Singleton Implementation for Consistency**
   - This provides a solid foundation for global state management
   - It's the most self-contained change with minimal dependencies
   - Other changes will build upon properly managed singleton lifecycles
   - This is a relatively straightforward change with high impact

2. **Create Interfaces and Proper Abstraction**
   - Establishes the contracts and boundaries between systems
   - Creates necessary separation of concerns before implementing events
   - The interface definitions will inform how your event system should be structured
   - Makes subsequent changes easier by decoupling components

3. **Implement a Proper Event System**
   - Builds on clear interfaces and consistent singletons
   - Creates the communication backbone between your decoupled components
   - Enables subsequent steps by allowing independent systems to communicate
   - Serves as the foundation for responsive system interactions

4. **Implement Centralized Resource/State Management**
   - Leverages the event system to manage and communicate state changes
   - Consolidates validation logic that's currently scattered
   - Creates the foundation needed for more advanced AI strategies
   - Ensures consistent rule enforcement across the system

5. **Separate AI Logic from Main Controller**
   - Builds on all previous improvements
   - Leverages the event system for AI decision-making
   - Utilizes the centralized state manager for move validation
   - This separation is most valuable after other foundational changes

## Conclusion

These five architectural improvements will provide the strongest foundation for the TCG-World project as it scales in complexity. By implementing them in the recommended order, you'll create a progression where each change reinforces and builds upon the previous ones, minimizing rework and maximizing efficiency.

Following this implementation plan will create a more maintainable and extensible system that can grow with your project's needs while keeping technical debt to a minimum.
