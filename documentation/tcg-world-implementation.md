## Implementation Details

### Current JSON Format

The currently implemented JSON format follows this structure:

```json
{
  "gameInfo": {
    "name": "Sample Card Game",
    "description": "A simple trading card game",
    "playerCount": 2,
    "initialPlayerHealth": 20
  },
  "zones": [
    {
      "name": "Deck",
      "perPlayer": true,
      "isPublic": false,
      "isOrdered": true,
      "maxCards": 60
    },
    {
      "name": "Hand",
      "perPlayer": true,
      "isPublic": false,
      "isOrdered": false,
      "maxCards": 10
    },
    {
      "name": "Field",
      "perPlayer": true,
      "isPublic": true,
      "isOrdered": false,
      "maxCards": 7
    },
    {
      "name": "Discard",
      "perPlayer": true,
      "isPublic": true,
      "isOrdered": true,
      "maxCards": -1
    }
  ],
  "turnStructure": {
    "firstPlayerDraws": 3,
    "normalDrawCount": 1,
    "resourceSystem": {
      "startingAmount": 1,
      "maxAmount": 10,
      "gainPerTurn": 1
    },
    "phases": [
      {
        "name": "Draw Phase",
        "allowedActions": ["draw"]
      },
      {
        "name": "Main Phase",
        "allowedActions": ["playCard", "activateAbility", "attack"]
      },
      {
        "name": "End Phase",
        "allowedActions": ["endTurn"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "winConditions": [
    {
      "type": "healthReduction",
      "threshold": 0
    },
    {
      "type": "deckDepletion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Current Card Format

Cards are currently defined in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Fireball",
      "type": "Spell",
      "cost": 3,
      "attack": 0,
      "health": 0,
      "description": "Deal 3 damage to any target.",
      "tags": ["spell", "damage"],
      "artworkUrl": "https://example.com/fireball.png"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Goblin Warrior",
      "type": "Creature",
      "cost": 2,
      "attack": 2,
      "health": 1,
      "description": "A small but aggressive goblin fighter.",
      "tags": ["goblin", "warrior"],
      "artworkUrl": "https://example.com/goblin.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Class Reference

### Core Game Logic
- **MainGame.cs**: Central controller that manages turn flow, player actions, and state
- **GameRulesInterpreter.cs**: Loads/parses JSON rules and validates gameplay actions

### Card System
- **Card.cs**: Represents a single card with properties and behaviors
- **CardZone.cs**: Manages card collections (deck, hand, field, etc.)
- **PlayerDeckManager.cs**: Loads card definitions and creates instances
- **CardImageLoader.cs**: Downloads and caches remote card artwork

### Visual Components
- **CardVisuals.cs**: Handles 3D card representation on the X,Z plane
- **CameraSetup.cs**: Configures camera for top-down view of the game board
- **CardVisualFixer.cs**: Utility to fix card visual scaling issues

### Utility Classes
- **SingletonBehaviour.cs**: Base class for singleton pattern implementation

### Interfaces
- **ICard.cs**: Interface for card objects
- **ICardContainer.cs**: Interface for zones and card collections
- **IGameRule.cs**: Interface for rule interpretation

## Current Limitations

- The implemented AI player is extremely rudimentary - it simply plays the highest cost card it can afford with no strategy
- Card effects defined in JSON are not fully processed - only basic card properties are used
- Cards are rendered but lack sophisticated visual effects and animations
- No support for multiplayer gameplay
- No persistence of game state between sessions
- No user creation tools or editors

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Enhanced Effect System**:
   - Implement effect resolution for cards based on JSON definitions
   - Add targeting and selection mechanisms
   - Create effect queue for proper ordering

2. **Improve AI Player**:
   - Implement basic strategic decision making
   - Consider board state when making plays
   - Add combat logic

3. **User Interface Improvements**:
   - Enhanced card visuals
   - Better feedback for player actions
   - Game state visualization

4. **Future Integration Work**:
   - Build foundation for LLM integration
   - Prepare for Lua scripting system

## Notes for Developers

- The core game engine is functional but basic - it loads JSON and creates a playable game but with limited mechanics
- Cards are properly parented to their zones in the hierarchy
- Cards are displayed flat on the X,Z plane with the camera looking down
- Use SingletonBehaviour<T> for service-type components and override OnAwake() instead of Awake()
- Access singleton instances via ComponentName.Instance
- Card dimensions are standardized at 1x1.4 units (width x length) with 0.1 unit thickness
- Cards are positioned using layoutOrigin and layoutDirection in the CardZone class
- The project uses Newtonsoft.Json for parsing JSON data
