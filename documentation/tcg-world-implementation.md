   - Implement card effect description processing
   - Develop the AI opponent system

3. **Lua Script System**:

4. **User Interface Improvements**:
   - Card creation interface
   - Deck building tools

## Notes for Developers

- The current implementation focuses on the core game engine fundamentals
- The code uses a component-based design with clear interfaces
- Use the SingletonBehaviour pattern for service-type components
- Override OnAwake() instead of Awake() when using this pattern
- Access singleton instances via ComponentName.Instance
- Follow the existing code style and patterns when adding new features
- Add robust error handling for user-provided data (JSON parsing, etc.)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing rule formats
- Add new features incrementally, with clear documentation
