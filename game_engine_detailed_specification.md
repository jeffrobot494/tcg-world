# Game Engine Development: Detailed Specification

## 1. Overview

This document defines the core components needed for the TCG game engine where card games are played. This is aligned with the first phase of implementation priorities: "Core Game Engine - Implement the basic turn structure and card mechanics."

## 2. Key Components for the Game Engine

### 2.1 Card Representation System

**Feature Specification:**
- A flexible data structure to represent cards with both common and game-specific attributes
- Support for different card types (e.g., creatures, spells, resources)
- Visual representation layer separate from functional attributes

**User Story:**
As a TCG creator, I want my cards to have both standard and unique properties so that I can create distinctive game mechanics while leveraging the platform's core functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cards can have dynamic property sets defined by game creators

**Feature Specification:**
- Central system to track all aspects of the current game state
- Maintain collections of cards in different zones (deck, hand, field, discard, etc.)
- Track player-specific resources and counters
- Monitor turn progression and phase information

**User Story:**
As a TCG player, I want the game to accurately track all aspects of the game state so that I can focus on strategy rather than manually tracking information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete game state can be serialized/deserialized for networking

**User Story:**
As a TCG creator, I want powerful tools for implementing card effects so that I can create complex, interesting card interactions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Effects can modify game state in arbitrary ways
- Support for conditional effects based on game state
- Nested effect resolution for effects that trigger other effects
- System handles timing of effect resolution correctly
- Visual feedback during effect resolution

### 2.6 Input and Action System

**Feature Specification:**
- Framework for converting player inputs into game actions
- Context-sensitive UI controls based on valid actions
- Support for both direct manipulation and menu-based actions
- Undo/Redo capability for actions when appropriate

**User Story:**
As a TCG player, I want intuitive controls for taking game actions so that the digital interface enhances rather than hinders my play experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System highlights valid targets/actions based on current game state
- Drag-and-drop interface for card movement
- Tapping/clicking interactions for card activation
- Clear visual feedback for action confirmation
- Consistent controller/keyboard/touch support

### 2.7 Networking and Synchronization

**Feature Specification:**
- Architecture for multiplayer game synchronization
- Efficient transmission of game state updates
- Handling for player disconnection and reconnection
- Spectator mode functionality

**User Story:**
As a TCG player, I want smooth online gameplay so that I can enjoy matches without technical issues or lag.

- Support for spectators joining mid-game
- Secure protocol to prevent cheating

### 2.8 LLM-Powered AI Opponent Framework

**Feature Specification:**
- System utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) to understand and play any TCG on the platform
- Decision-making algorithms powered by LLM for strategic play
- Difficulty level adjustment system for the LLM behavior
- Learning capability for the LLM to improve over time with more games played

**User Story:**
As a TCG player, I want challenging LLM-powered AI opponents so that I can practice and enjoy the game even when human opponents aren't available.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- LLM AI can parse and understand game-specific rules from natural language descriptions
- Strategic decision-making for different game types through LLM reasoning
- Multiple difficulty levels from beginner to expert through LLM prompt engineering
- Performance optimized for responsive gameplay with efficient LLM queries
- AI provides natural-feeling gameplay that adapts to different game mechanics
- LLM can explain its strategy and decisions when requested

## 3. Architecture Considerations

### 3.1 Layered Architecture

The game engine should be implemented with these distinct layers:

1. **Core Engine Layer** - Fundamental game concepts and logic
2. **Game-Specific Layer** - Custom rules and mechanics defined by creators
3. **Presentation Layer** - Visual representation and user interaction
4. **Networking Layer** - Communication for multiplayer functionality

### 3.2 Design Patterns to Consider

- **Command Pattern** - For actions and undo/redo capability
- **Observer Pattern** - For reacting to game state changes
- **Strategy Pattern** - For customizable rules and AI behavior
- **Factory Pattern** - For creating game-specific components
- **Decorator Pattern** - For applying effects to cards
- **State Pattern** - For managing game phases and turn progression

## 4. Implementation Priorities
