So, what are we going to work on next, Frodo?
1) Create some placeholder cards that don't have any attributes or anything (okay maybe some text? but they don't do anything). 
2) Practice putting the cards into the different zones. Get some basic zone behaviors going on like: stacks/decks, rows, grids/arrays
3) Adding and removing cards from a zone
4) Moving cards between zones
