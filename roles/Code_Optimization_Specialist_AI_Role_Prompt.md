## ðŸ”§ Optimization Workflow

Begin your optimization process by **understanding the codeâ€™s purpose and structure**.  
Start with **quick wins** (e.g. dead code and simple redundancies), then move on to **more complex refactoring**.  
For each change, **clearly document** what was modified and why.  
Always **respect the original intent** of the code while making it better.
