# Rules Interpreter Specification Outline - Adapted for AI Agent Development

## 1. Overview

The Rules Interpreter is the core component of our TCG platform that processes game rules defined in JSON format and enforces them during gameplay. This specification outlines a modular approach optimized for development by AI agents with limited context windows.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

1. Parse and validate rules documents
2. Initialize game state based on rules
3. Validate player actions against rules
4. Execute actions and apply effects
5. Manage turn progression
6. Enforce win/loss conditions
7. Provide API for UI integration

## 3. High-Level Architecture

## 4. Key Interface Patterns

### 4.1 Interface-First Development

- Each component defines a clear interface with detailed documentation
- All dependencies are injected through interfaces
- Implementation details are hidden behind these interfaces
- Example pattern:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Evaluates conditions in the game rules
/// </summary>
public interface IConditionEvaluator
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Evaluates a condition in the current game state
    /// </summary>
    bool EvaluateCondition(ICondition condition, IGameAction action, IGameState gameState);
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Registers a custom condition evaluator
    /// </summary>
    void RegisterConditionHandler(string conditionType, Func<dynamic, IGameAction, IGameState, bool> handler);
}
```

### 4.2 Component Decomposition

- Break large components into smaller subcomponents
- Each subcomponent should have a single responsibility
- Example decomposition:

```
RulesValidator
│
├── ActionValidator
│   ├── TargetValidator
│   ├── CostValidator
│   └── TimingValidator
│
├── ConditionEvaluator
│   ├── StateConditionEvaluator
│   ├── CardConditionEvaluator
│   └── PlayerConditionEvaluator
```

## 5. Data Model Overview

### 5.1 Core Data Structures

- **GameRules**: Contains the complete rule set for a game
- **Card**: Represents a card in the game with properties and state
- **Zone**: Area where cards can exist (deck, hand, field, etc.)
- **Player**: Contains player state including resources
- **GameAction**: Represents a player action with parameters
- **GameState**: Central state container for the entire game

### 5.2 Key Data Flow Patterns

1. Rules defined in JSON are parsed into structured objects
2. Player actions are validated against these rules
3. Valid actions affect the game state
4. State changes trigger events for UI updates
5. State is persisted for replays and reconnections

## 6. Development Approach for AI Agents

### 6.1 Development Sequence

1. **Stage 1**: Core data structures and interfaces
2. **Stage 2**: Game state management
3. **Stage 3**: Rules validation
4. **Stage 4**: Action processing
5. **Stage 5**: System integration

### 6.2 Implementation Strategy

- **Interface First**: Define interfaces before implementation
- **Test Driven**: Create tests for each component
- **Bottom-Up**: Build lower-level components first
- **Continuous Integration**: Frequently merge and test
- **Documentation Heavy**: Comment all public methods

### 6.3 Knowledge Transfer Protocol

When handing off components between AI agents:

1. Interface definitions with XML documentation
2. Implementation notes
3. Test cases
4. Dependency list
5. Known limitations

## 7. JSON Schema Approach

- Formal JSON Schema defines all data structures
- Schema used for both validation and documentation
- Schema enforces required fields and type constraints
- Example of schema organization:
  - Game rules schema
  - Card definitions schema
  - Action schema

## 8. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test each component in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Scenario Tests**: Test complete game scenarios
- **Mock Objects**: Create test doubles for dependencies
- **Snapshot Testing**: Compare state before/after actions

## 9. Extensibility Mechanisms

- **Plugin System**: Register custom conditions and effects
- **Rule Overrides**: Game-specific rule extensions
- **Custom Validators**: Game-specific validation logic
- **Event Hooks**: Custom reactions to game events

## 10. Next Steps for Implementation

1. Define formal interface contracts for all components
2. Create JSON schema for game rules
3. Implement core data structures
4. Build test framework
5. Implement components in dependency order
