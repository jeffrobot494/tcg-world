# TCG World Development Session Summary

## Overview
In this session, we began rebuilding the TCG World game engine with a clean, simplified architecture focused on getting core functionality working properly. We started with a rules-as-data approach and implemented the foundation for zone visualization.

## Components Developed

### Data Layer
- Created **GameRules** class with proper JSON deserialization
- Implemented **ZoneDefinition** with layout properties
- Developed **ZoneData** as runtime representation of zones
- Set up **DataLoader** for JSON parsing
- Created serializable vector classes for Unity integration

### View Layer
- Implemented **ZoneView** for zone visualization
- Designed runtime-based creation (no prefabs)
- Added debug visualization with customizable appearance
- Solved critical rotation and orientation issues

### Test Framework
- Created **ZoneVisualTest** to load and test the system
- Simplified to focus on just the core functionality
- Enabled easy testing of JSON-based configurations

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Data/View Separation**:
   - Clear distinction between definitions (JSON), runtime data, and visualization
   - ZoneDefinition (config) → ZoneData (runtime) → ZoneView (visualization)

2. **Zone Orientation**:
   - Established standard game orientation on X/Z plane
   - Created intuitive JSON schema where (0,0,0) means "flat on table"
   - Implemented proper rotation handling for Unity's coordinate system

3. **JSON Schema**:
   - Simplified for minimal initial implementation
   - Made rotation values match user's mental model
   - Created foundation for future extensibility

4. **Creation Approach**:
   - Chose runtime object creation over prefabs
   - Eliminated unnecessary complexity
   - ZoneView creates all required components dynamically

## Issues Resolved

1. **Visibility Problem**: Fixed issue where zones were only visible when selected in hierarchy
   - Root cause: Misunderstanding of Unity's rotation system
   - Solution: Properly applied base orientation + layout rotation

2. **Coordinate System Confusion**: Clarified relationship between:
   - Unity's default coordinates (Y-up)
   - Card game's logical orientation (X/Z plane)
   - JSON data representation

3. **Schema Philosophy**: Established that JSON values should match intuitive understanding
   - Technical implementation details stay in code
   - JSON represents user's mental model

## Current Project State

The system now:
- Successfully loads game rules from JSON
- Creates runtime zone objects with correct positioning
- Properly visualizes zones on the X/Z plane
- Has clear separation between data and visualization layers

## Next Steps

Potential focus areas for the next session:
1. Implementing card representation and visualization
2. Creating card movement between zones
3. Adding player representation
4. Implementing basic turn structure
5. Enhancing the JSON schema for more complex rules

## Development Principles

We established important principles for this project:
- Fix issues by understanding root causes
- Validate assumptions before implementing
- Make data representations match mental models
- Focus on minimal working implementations first
- Use systematic debugging and clear logging
