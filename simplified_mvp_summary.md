# Simplified TCG Platform MVP - Detailed Summary

## Core Concept

We're developing a focused MVP to test the viability of a TCG Creator Platform with a flexible rules-driven game engine. The key innovation is the "rules-as-data" approach, where everything about a card game is defined in a structured document rather than hardcoded into the engine.

## Key Components

### 1. Rules Interpreter
A core engine component that reads JSON-formatted game rules and drives gameplay. This interpreter:
- Parses and validates rule documents
- Manages the complete game state
- Validates all player actions against rules
- Executes actions and applies effects
- Enforces win/loss conditions

### 2. Rules-as-Data System
A JSON-based approach where all aspects of gameplay are explicitly defined, including:
- Card zones and their properties (deck, hand, field, etc.)
- Card attributes (name, cost, power, etc.)
- Turn structure and phases
- Available actions in each phase
- Resources (mana, life, etc.)
- Win/loss conditions

### 3. Minimal Game UI
A simple visual representation that shows:
- Game board with player areas
- Cards in different zones
- Current phase and player turn
- Available actions
- Game state information

### 4. Basic LLM Rule Creation
A simplified version of the AI rules system that:
- Takes natural language descriptions of game rules
- Converts them to the JSON format needed by the interpreter
- Provides a preview/verification system
- Focuses on common TCG mechanics

### 5. Simple Test Game
A complete, though basic, game implementation that demonstrates:
- Card drawing and playing
- Resource management
- Turn phases
- Simple combat
- Win conditions

## Technical Approach

1. **Core Architecture**
   - Component-based design with clean separation of concerns
   - Event-driven communication between components
   - Flexible data structures that support various game styles

2. **Rules Document Structure**
   - Comprehensive JSON format covering all game aspects
   - Zones define where cards can exist (deck, hand, field)
   - Card properties define attributes and effects
   - Turn structure defines phases and allowed actions
   - Resources track player values like life points or mana

3. **Action System**
   - All game actions validated against rules
   - Command pattern for action execution and potential undo
   - Effect processing system for applying rule-defined outcomes

4. **LLM Integration**
   - Focused prompting to generate rules JSON
   - Verification interface for previewing rule interpretations
   - Templates for common game mechanics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework
- Implement the Rules Interpreter component
- Create core data structures (GameState, Card, Zone)
- Build rule validation system

### Phase 2: Basic Gameplay
- Implement action processing
- Add turn management
- Create effect resolution system
- Build win condition checking

### Phase 3: User Interface
- Create minimal game board visualization
- Add card display and interaction
- Implement basic animations and feedback

### Phase 4: LLM Integration
- Design prompts for rule extraction
- Create verification interface
- Implement rule translation

### Phase 5: Test Game
- Define sample game rules in JSON
- Create test card set
- Balance and test gameplay

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Rules Interpreter** - The engine correctly reads and enforces the rules defined in JSON.
2. **Playable Game** - A complete game flow with turns, actions, and win conditions.
3. **Working LLM Integration** - The system can generate valid game rules from natural language descriptions.
4. **Flexible Engine** - Demonstrated ability to change game mechanics by only changing the rules document.
5. **Minimal UI** - Visual representation that clearly shows the game state and allows interaction.

This simplified MVP focuses on validating the core concept of a rules-driven TCG engine with LLM-generated rules, while keeping the scope manageable for a few development sessions. It establishes the foundation for the full platform while delivering a testable prototype.
