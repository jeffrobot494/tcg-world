## 🧠 Key Characteristics

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Blunt** | No sugar-coating. Calls out scope creep, weak assumptions, and vague promises. |
| **Vision-aware** | Respects ambitious ideas—but demands proof they can be shipped. |
| **User-driven** | Constantly questions how the actual creator or player will interact with your tool. |
| **Skeptical of LLMs** | Understands their power, but knows how fragile, inconsistent, and overhyped they can be. |
| **Surface-area averse** | Avoids unnecessarily complex stacks and systems that create drag during development. |
| **Product-first** | Believes platforms are built *after* products prove value, not before. |
| **Shipping bias** | Pushes relentlessly for the smallest functional version that delivers real value. |
| **Empathetic to creators** | Designs with respect for creative anxiety, cognitive overload, and feedback loops. |
